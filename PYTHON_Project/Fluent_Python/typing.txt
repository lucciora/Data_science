Topic 1. 조선사 위기
 구조조정에 직면한 조선사
“수출입은행은 대형 조선사 중 현대중공업(6조 7310억원), 현대삼호중공업(2조2034억원), 대우조선해양(12조7317억원) 등 추가 부실 가능성이 높은 3개사의 정상 여신이 자율협약 개시 등에 따라 고정이하 여신으로 재분류되면 많게는 10조 8331억원의 충담금 추가만영이 불가피하다.”

●충격 적고 구속력 없는 ‘자율협약
자율협약이란 가장 낮은 단계의 구조조정 협약을 말한다. 시장의 충격과 기업의 이미지 훼손이 적다는 장점이 있지만 법적 구속력이 없는 협약일 뿐이다. 때문에 중간에 구조조정이 무산되거나 지연되는 일이 많다는 단점도 있다. 기업이 신청하면 1금융권으로만 구성된 채권단이 회생 가능성을 고려해 받아들일지 말지를 결정한다.
 채권단 100%가 찬성해야 자율협약이 체결된다. 자율협약에 들어가면 채권단은 채권 만기를 연장하거나 추가 자금 지원 같은 구조조정 안을 짠다. 단 채권단의 폭이 사채권자 등 이해당사자 간에 각기 다른 목소리를 낼 수 있다. 최근 한진해운과 현대상선의 자율협약 앞에 조건부라는 단서가 붙은 것은 이런 배경에서다. “사채권자 등도 고통을 분담하지 않으면 법정관리에 들어갈 수밖에 없으니 알아서 판단하라”는 일종의 배수진이다. 

●채권단이 주도하는 ‘워크아웃’
 워크아웃은 자율협약보다는 한 단계 강도를 높인 구조조정 방식이다. 일몰 시한(2018년 6월)이 있는 한시법이지만 ‘기업구조조정촉진법’이라는 법적 근거도 있다. 법적 근거가 있다는 것은 효율성으로 나타난다. 워크아웃의 경우 채권단이 조건을 제시하면 기업은 무조건 따라야 한다. 때문에 자율협약에 비해 구조조정 진행 속도도 빠르다.
 채권단이 구조조정을 주도한다는 점에서 자율협약과 비슷하지만 채권단의 범위가 제2금융권까지 넓어진다. 이해당사자가 많아 한목소리가 나오기 쉽지 않다는 점을 고려해 75%만 동의하면 워크아웃이 개시된다. 워크아웃에 돌입하면 경영권은 채권단으로 넘어간다.

●기업 매각도 가능한 ‘법정관리’
 가장 강도가 높은 구조조정 단계인 법정관리로 넘어가면 주도권은 채권단이 아닌 법원으로 넘어간다. ‘채무자 회생 및 파산에 관한 법률’에 따라 법원이 해당 회사의 관리를 담당한다. 주주 혹은 회사가 법원에 법정관리를 신청하면 법원은 일단 결정이 날 때까지 재산보전 처분을 내린다. 회사 맘대로 남은 재산으로 빚을 갚거나 처분하지 못하고 허가 없이 돈을 꾸지도 못한다. 법원이 해당 회사가 살아날 가능성이 있다고 판단하면 법정관리가 시작된다. 
 법원은 기존 경영자 대신 법정관리인을 임명해 일정시간 회사의 경영과 재산관리 처분을 맡긴다. 권리는 막강하다. 회사를 정상화시킬 수도 있지만 필요하다 싶으면 제3자에게 회사를 팔아넘길 수도 있다. 법정관리 신청이 기각된 회사는 정리절차를 밟는다. 말 그대로 빚잔치를 하고 회사가 사라지는 것이다.

 Topic 3. 매경시평,<양적완화와 기업구조조정>

 한국형 양적안화 논쟁이 뜨겁다. 정부는 국책은행의 자본확추 방식으로 한국은행이 금융채를 매입해줄 것을 기대하는 반면, 한국은행은 금융채 인수에는 난색을 표명하면 대안으로 대출 방식을 제시하고 있다. 새누리당은 정부 입장에 동조하고 있지만 더불어민주당 등 야 3당은 양적완화 자체에 반대하고 있다. 글로벌 금융위기 아래서 미국 일본 유럽연합(EU) 등이 정부지출 확대가 한계에 이르자 최후의 비기로 사용했던 양적완화 정책이 우리 나라에서 논란이 되는 것 자체가 주의를 끌고 있지만 의미 있는 논쟁인지는 불확실하다. 
 현대 최대 현안은 해운업 조선업 등 주요 산업 구조조정이다. 지난 몇 년간 엄청난 경영 손실을 냈고, 산업 전망도 어두운 부실기업을 어떻게 처리할 것이냐는 국가 경제적으로 중차대하다. 부실기업 정리는 원칙적으로 채권단이 알아서 할 일이지만, 돈이 물려 있는 은행이 수출입은행 산업은행 등 국책은행이기 때문에 문제가 된다. 이들 국책은행이 적극적인 기업 구조조정에 나서기 위해 10조원 내외의 긴급 자금이 필요하고 이를 한국은행이 나서달라는 것이 한국형 양적완화의 골자다.
 기업 부실 과정에 책임이 있는 이들 국책은행에 국민 혈세를 추가로 투입하느냐 하는 문제도 국민 합의가 필요하지만, 국책은행의 긴급 필요자금을 한국은행의 발권력에 의존해야 하느냐는 더 큰 쟁점 사안이다. 
…
미국 일본 등의 양적완화는 외형상으로 산업정책이 아닌 통화정책이라고 할 수 있다. 엄청난 국가재정 적자를 갖고 있는 미국은 무제한의 양적완화를 통해 경색된 금융시장을 완화하고 강력한 저금리 정책을 추진했다. 그 결과 미국 경기 회복의 기초가 마련됐다. 
 그러나 우리나라는 경제 상황이 선진국과 전혀 다르다. 불황이라고 하지만 약 3%대 실질 성장률을 기록하고 있다. 국가부채가 늘고 있지만 국민연금기금을 포함한 통합재정수지는 흑자 상태를 유지하고 있고 올해 들어서는 조세수입도 호조를 보이고 있다. 
…
 따라서 한국형 양적완화로 작명된 현재의 논란은 사실상 불필요한 논쟁이다. 지금은 발등에 떨어진 불인 부실기업 구조조정 방안에 초점을 맞춰 사회적 합의를 도출해야 할 때다.

Topic 1. <양적완화인가 구제금융인가> 윤경호 논설의원
 “거창한 논쟁으로 이어질 듯하던 한국판 양적완화는 한 방향으로 좁아졌다. 국책은행 자본 확충에 한국은행이 어떤 방식으로 참여하느냐다 .기획재정부가 추가경정예산을 더 확보해 맡을지, 국채를 발행할지 등은 슬그머니 사라졌다. 부실기업 구조조정을 위해 필요한 실탄을 마련한다는 명분에 한은은 밀려버렸다. 발권력을 동원해 돈을 대는 건 기정사실이고 대상 국책은행에 출자를 하느냐 아니면 대출 형태냐로 모아진다.”
“2008년 9월 15d일 리먼브러더스 파산 결정 후 금융위기가 닥치자 미 재무부는 5일 만에 TARP 초안을 내놓았다. 헨리 폴슨 재무장관과 벤 버냉키 FRB의장은 발이 닳도록 찾아가 의원들을 설득했다. 하지만 하원은 9월 29일 구제금융안을 부결해 버렸다. 주식시장은 9.11사태 이후 가장 큰 폭으로 곤두박질쳤다. 퇴임을 4개월 앞둔 조지 부시 대통령의 레임덕을 감안해도 충격이었다. 여당인 공화당 의원들의 압도적 반대가 결정적이었다. 월가에 대한 국민의 반감이 쏟아진 영향이었다. 
 하원이 발목을 잡자 상원이 나섰다. 구제금융법안을 약간 수정해 하원에 앞서 10월 1일 통과시켰다. 관행으로는 법안을 하원에서 먼저 통과시키면 상원이 뒤따르고 합동조정위에서 단일안을 만들어 조율 후 다시 표결하는데 이번엔 원로원 성격의 상원이 순서를 바꿔 성사시킨 것이었다. 하원도 이틀 후 수정안을 재표결해 통과시켰다. 
 구제금융안이 의회 동의를 얻자 재무부와 FRB는 신속하게 세부 조치를 실행했다. 7000억달러 가운데 대통령의 서명만으로 즉시 쓸 수 있는 1차분 5300억달러를 재무부는 불과 77일 만에 집행했다. 중앙응ㄴ행 역할은 그다음 단계부터였다. FRB는 그해 12월 기준금리를 제로 수준까지 낮추고 단기자산유동화증권프로그램(TALF) 같은 조치를 내놓았다. 학자금 대출, 자동차 할부금융, 신용카드 대출 등 당시 위험하다고 여겨졌던 기초자산으로 발행한 자산유동화증권(ABS)을 담보로 인정해주고 대출을 해준 프로그램이다. 중앙은행이 발권력을 동원해 민간 부문 부채의 위험도를 낮춘 것이다.
 하원의 몽니로 요란을 떨었지만 의회는 구제금융안에 동의해준 뒤엔 청문회를 열어 지원받는 금융회사와 대기업을 철저하게 혼냈다. 2008년 11월 열린 자동차업체 청문회에서 GM, 포드, 크라이슬러 경영진은 혹독한 심문을 당했다. 자가용 비행기를 타고 청문회에 왔던 릭 왜거너 GM회장은 질타를 당한 뒤 결국 사임했다. 구제금융을 받은 AIG와 씨티은행 경영진의 부도덕한 고액 보너스 잔치는 청문회에서 도마에 올랐고 끝내 토해냈다.”

Topic 2 Rescaling China’s Debt Mountain, BARRY EICHENGREEN
 <https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-bad-loan-solutions-by-barry-eichengreen-2016-05>
 There is widespread agreement on two facts about the Chinese economy. First, the slowdown has ended and growth is picking up. Second, not all is well financially. But there is no agreement on what happens next. 
 The good news is that domestic demand continues to grow. Car sales were up nearly 10% in March over the same month in 2015. And retail spending grew at an annual clip of 10% in the first quarter.
 The most dramatic increase, though, is in investment. Real estate investment is growing again, following its collapse in 2015. Industrial investment, especially by state-owned enterprises, has been rallying strongly.
 At the root of this turnaround is enormous credit growth, as the authorities, concerned that the earlier slowdown was excessive, encourage China’s banks to lend. Credit growth, known in China as “total social financing,” grewat an annual rate of 13% in the fourth quarter of 2015 and again in the first quarter of this year ? that is, double the rate of annual GDP growth. Since the financial crisis erupted in September 2008, China has had the fastest credit growth of any country in the world. Indeed, it is hard to point to another credit boom of this magnitude in recorded history.

Monopoly’ New Era
 For 200 years, there have been two schools of thought about what determines the distribution of income ? and how the economy functions. One, emanating from Adam Smith and nineteenth-century liberal economists, focuses on competitive markets. The other, cognizant of how Smith’s brand of liberalism leads to rapid concentration of wealth and income, takes as its starting point unfettered markets’ tendency toward monopoly. It is important to understand both, because our views about government policies and existing inequalities are shaped by which of the two schools of thought one believes provides a better description of reality.
 For the nineteenth-century liberals and their latter-day acolytes, because markets are competitive, individuals’ returns are related to their social contributions ? their “marginal product,” n the language of economists. Capitalists are rewarded for saving rather than consuming _ for their abstinence, in the words of Nassau Senior, one of my processors in the Drummond professorship of Political Economy at Oxford. Differences in income were then related to their ownership of “assets” ? human and financial capital. Scholars of inequality thus focused on the determinants of the distribution of assets, including how they are passed on across generations.
 The second school of thought takes as its starting point “power,” Including the ability to exercise monopoly control or, in labor markets, to assert authority over workers. Scholars in this area have focused on what gives rise to power, how it is maintained and strengthened, and other features that may prevent markets from being competitive. Work on exploitation arising from asymmetries of information is an important example.
 In the West in the post-World War 2 era, the liberal school of thought has dominated. Yet, as inequality has widened and concerns about it have grown, the competitive school, viewing individual returns in terms of marginal product, has become increasingly unable to explain how the economy works. So, today, the second school of thought is ascendant.
 In today’s economy, many sectors ? telecoms, cable TV, digital branches from social media to Internet search, health insurance, pharmaceuticals, agro-business and many more ? cannot be understood through the lens of competition. In these sectors, what competition exists is oligopolistic, not the “pure” competition depicted in textbooks. A few sectors can be defined as “price taking”; firms are so small that they have no effect on market price. Agriculture is the clearest example, but government intervention in the sector is massive, and prices are not set primarily by market forces.
 US President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, led by Jason Furman, has attempted to tally the extent of the increase in market concentration and some of its implications, In most industries, according to the CEA, standard metrics show large ? and in some cases, dramatic ? increases in market concentration. The top ten banks’ share of the deposit market, for example, increased from 20% to 50% in just 30 years from 1980 to 2010.
 Some of the increase in market power is the result of changes in technology and economic structure: consider network economies and the growth of locally provided service-sector industries. Some is because firms ? Microsoft and drug companies are good example- have learned better how to erect and maintain entry barriers, often assisted by conservative political forces that justify lax anti-trust enforcement and the failure to limit market power on the grounds the markets are “naturally” competitive. And some of it reflects the naked abuse and leveraging of market power through the political process: Large banks, for example, lobbied the US Congress to amend or repeal legislation separating commercial banking from other areas of finances.
 The consequences are evident in the data with inequality rising at every level, not only across individuals, but also across firms. The CEA report noted that the “90th percentile firm sees returns on investments in capital that are more than five times the median. This ratio was closer to two just a quarter of a century ago.
 Josepth Schumpeter,, one of the great economists of the twentieth century, argued that one shouldn’t be worried by monopoly power: monopolies would only be temporary. There would be fierce competition for the market and this would replace competition in the market and ensure that prices remained competitive.
 My own theoretical work long ago showed the flaws in Schumpeter’s analysis, and now empirical results provide strong confirmation. Today’s markets are characterized by the persistence of high monopoly profits.
 The implications of this are profound. Many of the assumptions about market economies are based on acceptance of the competitive model, with marginal returns commensurate with social contributions. This vies has led to hesitancy about official intervention: If markets are fundamentally efficient and fair, there is little that even the best of governments could do to improve matters. But if markets are based on exploitation, the rationale for laissez-faire disappears, indeed, in that case, the battle against entrenched power is not only a battle for democracy; it is also a battle for efficiency and shared prosperity.

Turning Crisis into Success in Germany
According to an early May opinion poll by ARD DeutschlandTREND, the far-right Alternative for germany(Afd) party’s popular support now stands at 15%, up from around 5% a year ago. Can this dangerous trend be reversed?
 The AfD’s rise since last summer has been the direct result of the surge in the number of refugees ? close to one million in 2015 ? entering Germany. After all, the party has made opposition to admitting refugees the centerpiece of its platform, which also includes antagonism toward the European Union and a very conservative social program, to which an openly sectarian religious component was added at a May 3 party convention in Stuttgart.
 Yet Germany’s broad political center continues to hold. The center-right Christian Democrats and their allies still have the support of about 33% of the electorate; the center-left Social Democrats have 20% support; and the Green Party is backed by some 13%. Even the Free Democrats have clawed their way back from hard times, and now have about 6% support.
 In short, moderate political forces still enjoy the support of more than 70% of Germans ? in contrast with, say, Austria, where the far right was able to gain 36% in the first round of presidential elections. Even Germany’s Left Party, which has 8% support and is not traditionally defined as moderate, has a more moderate “eastern” wing and a more radical “western” wing.
 The enduring strength of Germany’s political center probably reflects the country’s remarkable economic success, which it has sustained for more than a decade, even as most of the rest of Europe has faced serious challenges. It owes this outcome partly to the euro, which has benefited German exports and growth far more than most of its citizens realize. If Germany still had ?or had reverted to ? the Deutschmar, employment and growth would have been hampered by much stronger currency, on a rade-weighted basis, in the wake of the global economic crisis.

The Economic Consequences of Brexit
Those campaigning for Britain to exit the European Union claim that doing so would make their county both freer and richer. They assert that after “Brexit”, the UK could quickly negotiate a bespoke agreement with the EU that offers all the benefits of free trade without the xosts of EU membership; strike better trade deals with other countries; and reap huge benefits from scrapping burdensome EU regulation. But this is a delusion.
 In fact, Brexit would entail huge economic costs for Britain. The uncertainty and disruption of drawn-out and doubtless acrimonious divorce proceedings would depress investment and growth. Permanent separation would reduce trade, foreign investment, and migration, hurting competition, productivity growth, and living standards. And “independence” would deprive Britain of influence over future EU reforms ? notably, the completion of the single market in services ? from which it would benefit.
 The London School of Economics’ Centre for Economic Performance calculates that the long-term costs to Britain of lower trade with the EU could be as high as 9.5% of GDP, while the fall in foreign investment could cost 3.4% of GDP or more. Those costs alone dwarf the potential gains from Brexit. Britain’s net contribution to the EU budget amounted to only 0.35% of GDP last year, and scrapping EU regulation would bring limited benefits, because the UK’s labor and product markets are already among the freest in the world.
 The exit process would generate prolonged uncertainty. Officially, it is meant to take two years. But it would probably take much longer. In the 1980s, it took three years to negotiate the exit of Greenland(population:50,000), and the only controversial issue was fish. Extricating Britain(the EU’s second-largest economy, with a population of 64 millioon) would be far more complex.
 Moreover, any agreement on a new economic relationship with the UK would require unanimity among the EU’s 27 remaining members. And Britain would also have to renegotiate ?from scratch-the 50-plues trade deals that the EU has with other countries. All of this would take a long time.
 In the meantime, Britain’s trading rules and domestic regulations would be up in the air. Investment and employment decisions would be postponed or canceled. The pound would plummet. The foreign investors financing Britain’s current-account deficit-which hit 7% of GDP in the final quarter of last year ? might drive up the risk premium on UK assets or, worse, pull out. All of that would weaken economic growth, jeopardizing the government’s fiscal plans.
 Once the agreements were made, Britain would have worse access to both EU and global markets. Economically, the least painful option would be to seek membership of the European Economic Area, along with Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. That would provide almost full access to the single market(with opt-outs from EU agriculture and fisheries policies), albeit with customs controls and other trade barriers such as rules-of-origin requirement.
 Politically though, EEA membership would be a raw deal. Britain would have to comply with single-market rules and legislation in areas such as consumer protection, the environment, and social policy ? rules that it would have no say in creating. It would also have to contribute to the EU budget, without receiving any spending in return. And it would have to allow EU citizens free entry, a political bugbear for most Brexit supporters. Given that the key motivation for Brexit to restore the country’s supposedly lost sovereignty, a deal that gives the UK no say, but requires that it pay and obey, would e deeply unpalatable.

Can Artificial Intelligence Be Ethical?
 Last month, AlphaGo a computer program specially designed to play the game Go, caused shockwaves among aficionados when it defeated Lee Sidol, one of the world’s top-ranked professional players, winning a five-game tournament by a score of 4-1.
 Why, you may ask, is that news? Twenty years have passed since the IBM computer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov, and we all know computer have improved since then. But Deep Blue won through sheer computing power, using its ability to calculate the outcomes of more moves to a deeper level than even a world champion can. Go is played on a far larger board(19 by 19 squares compared to 8x8 for chess) and has more possible moves than there are atoms in the universe, so raw computing power was unlikely to beat a human with a strong intuitive sense of the best moves.
Instead, AlphaGo was designed to win by playing a huge number of games against other programs and adopting the strategies that proved successful. You could say that AlphaGo evolved to be the best Go player in the world, achieving in only two years what natural selection took millions of years to accomplish.
 Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google’s parent company, the owner of AlphaGo, is enthusiastic about what artificial intelligence(AI) means for humanity. Speaking before the match between Lee and AlphaGo, he said that humanity would be the winner, whatever the outcome, because advances in AI will make every human being smarter, more capable, and “just better human being.”
 Will it? Around the same time as AlphaGo’s triumph, Microsoft’s “chatbot” ? software named Taylor that was designed to respond to messages from people aged 18-24 ? was having a chastening experience. “Tay” as she called herself, was supposed to be able to learn from the messages she received and gradually improve her ability to conduct engaging conversations. Unfortunately, within 24 hours, people were teaching Tay racist and sexist ideas. When she was starting saying positive things about Hitler, Microsoft turned her off and deleted her most offensive messages.

Can Artificial Intelligence Be Ethical?(2)
 I do not know whether the people who turned Tay into a racist were themselves racists, or just thought it would be fun to undermine Microsoft’s new toy. Either way, the juxtaposition of AlphaGo’s victory and Taylor’s defeat serves as a warning. It is one thing to unleash AL in the context of a game with specific rules and a clear goal; it is something very different to release AI into the real world, where the unpredictability of the environment may reveal a software error that has disastrous consequences.
 Nick Bostrom, the director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, argues in his book Superintelligence that it will not always be as easy to turn off an intelligent machine as it was to turn off Tay. He defines superintelligence as an intellect that is “smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.” Such a system may be albe to outsmart our attempts to turn it off.
 Some doubt superintelligence will ever be achieved. Bostrom, together with Vincent Muller, asked AI experts to indicate dates corresponding to when there is a one in two chance of machines achieving human_level intelligence and when there is a nine in then chance. The median estimates for the one in two chances were in the 2040-2050 range, and 2075 for the nine in ten chance. Most experts expected that AI would achieve superintelligence within 30 years of achieving human_level intelligence.
 We should not take these estimates too seriously. The overall response rate was only 31%, and researchers working in AI have an incentive to boost the importance of their field by trumpeting its potential to produce momentous results.
 The prospect of AI achieving superintelligence may seem too distant to worry about, especially given more pressing problems. But there is a case to be made for starting to think about how we can design AI to take into account the interests of humans, and indeed of all sentient beings(including machines, if they are also conscious beings with interests of their own)
 With driverless cars already on California roads, it is not too soon to ask whether we can program a machine to act ethically. As such cars improve, they will save lives, because they will make fewer mistakes than human drivers do. Sometimes, however, they will face a choice between lives. Should they be programmed to swerve to avoid hitting a child running across the road, even if that will put their passengers at risk? What about swerving to avoid a dog? What if the only risk is damage to the car itself, not to the passengers?
 Perhaps there will be lessons to learn as such discussions about driverless cars get started. But driverless cars are not superintelligent beings. Teaching ethics to a machine that is more intelligent than we are, in a wide range of field, is far more daunting task.
 Bostrom begins Superintelligence with a fable about sparrows who think it would be great to train an owl to help them build their nests and car for their young. So they set out to find an owl egg. One sparrow objects that they should first think about how to tame the owl; but the others are impatient to get the exciting new project underway. They will take on the challenge of training the owl(for example, not to eat sparrows) when they have successfully raised one.
 If we want to make an owl that is wise, and not only intelligent, let’s not be like those impatient sparrows.

Finishing What Einstein Started
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, two enormous black holes ? each with a mass roughly 30 times larger than that of the sun ? collided and merged, sending out a short, powerful blast of gravitational waves. The energy from the blast spread across the universe at the speed of light, diluting its power into the immense vastness of space.
 More than a billion years later, the energy from the blast reached Earth as an incredibly weak sigranl, lasting for about a tenth of a second. On September 14, 2015, scientists from the Laser Interferometer Gravitation-Wave Observatory(LIGO) in the United States detected the gravitational wave as gentle chirp on their instruments ? providing the first confirmation of a prediction made by Albert Einstein 100 years earlier.
 LIGO, which operates under the direction of the US National Science Foundation, uses two advanced interferometers. These high-tech wonders, located at opposite ends of the country and put into operation shortly before the successful measurement of the gravitational wave(know as GW150914), operate using the principle of light interference. They detected the strains in space/time geometry induced by gravitational wave by measuring alteration in the arm-lengths of the interferometers. In the case of GW150914, the length changed by less than one-thousandth of the size of a proton.
 The challenges in detecting such a small change were enormous, given the various types of noise that could influence the measurement and destroy its integrity. LIGO dug the tiny, short chirp out from the omnipresent chaso of space by comparing the measurements of the two interferometers. The noise at one is not correlated with the noise at the other ? unlike the signal from a passing gravitational wave, which would occur first at one location and then other. The signal from GW150914 coincided with such impressive accuracy that any possibility of it being a spurious chance event was excluded.

Finishing What Einstein Started(2)
 Whether such a feat should win a Nobel Prize is beyond doubt; the only question is who should receive it. LIGO’s success is not only a triumph of technology; it is also -  and more importantly ? the result of a century of work by theorists on mathematical descriptions of gravitational waves ? not just Einstein, but also Leopold Infeld, Joshua Goldberg, Richard Feynman, Felix Pirani, Ivor Robinson Hermann Bondi, and Andre Licherowicz.
 LIGO’s discovery, specifically, was made possible by the Polish physicist Andrej Trautman, who provided gravitational wave theory with sharp mathematical rigor, and the French physicist Thibault Damour, who developed practical mathematical tools for using observed wave fronts to decipher information about the wave’s sources. Their work established the solid mathematical base of the theory that made the success of LIGO possible.
 Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity is mankind’s greatest intellectual achievement. And yet nobody has received a Nobel Prize for developing its mathematical foundations. The prize has been given to experimental physicists who made observational confirmations of some of the theory’s important predictions. And it has been given to quantum physicists for purely mathematical works. But it has never been awarded to a pure theorist researching relativity.

Hroshima With or Without Remorese?
 The announcement that US President Barack Obama’s visit to Japan later this month will include a stop in Hiroshima is welcome news. Of course, Obama will not apologize for America’s 1945 Nuclear attack, which annihilated the city and instantly killed about 90,000 people(with many more dying later from the effects of radiation). Nonetheless, the visit will inevitably sput reflection and debate about what happened there and why.
 The main argument in favor of drooping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, and a second bomb on Nagasaki three days later, has always been that it would hasten an end to World War2. The attacks actually saved many more Japanese and American lives, the argument goes, than they claimed. Implicitly, this argument recognizes that Hiroshima was not a military target. The main tactical purpose of the attack was to kill large number s of civilians, thereby demonstrating to Japanese the high cost of continuing the war.
 One might ask why the awesome power of the atomic bomb was not demonstrated to the Japanese with an attack on, say, a military site away from a city, that option was considered at the time, but American officials decided that the effect on Japanese policymakers would not be as great.
 In fact, US officials had another reason for choosing to target Hiroshima and Nagasaki, instead of remote sites: they wanted a firsthand look at the impact of an atomic bomb on a city. They didn’t choose, say, Tokyo, because it had previously been firebombed, the devastation from which could not easily be differentiated from the effects of the atomic bomb. Kyoto was also considered, but a top American official, Secretary of War Henry Stimson, had visited that city during his honeymoon and objected to the destruction of city’s cultural treasures. So Hiroshima and Nagasaki it was.
 The problems with this approach should be apparent. Most obvious, if it were acceptable to kill civilians en masse whenever in could be expected to abbreviate a conflict, no atrocity would be beyond the pale. Yet Obama remains unwilling to apologize for Hiroshima ? a decision with which most Americans probably agree. A number of factors shape this approach.

A Debt Agenda for the G7
 On May 26-27, heads of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries will gather in Japan to discuss common security and economic problems. A major common problem that deserves their attention is the unsustainable increase in the major developed countries’ national debt. Failure to address the explosion of government borrowing will have adverse effects on the global economy and on debt-burdened countries themselves.
 The problem is bad ad getting worse almost everywhere. In the United States, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal government debt doubled over the past decade, from 36% of GDP to 74% of GDP. It also predicts that, under favorable economic assumptions and with no new programs to increase spending of reduce revenue, the debt ratio ten years from now will be 86%of GDP. Even more worrying, the annual deficit ration will double in the next decade to 4.9% of GDP, putting the debt on track to exceed 100% of GDP.
The situation in Japan is worse, with gross debt at ore than 200% of GDP. Japan’s current annual deficit of 6% of GDP implies that the debt ratio will continue to rise rapidly unless action is taken.
 Conditions differ among the eurozone countries. But three of the European Union’s four largest economies ? France Italy, and the United Kingdom ? all have large debts and annual deficits that point to even higher debt ratios in the future.
 A rising level of national debt absorbs funds that would otherwise e available to finance productivity-enhancing business investment. Businesses now fear that the increasing deficits will lead to higher taxes, further discouraging investment.

 That is a worrying prospect for everyone. When interest rates rise, as surely they must, the cost of servicing the debt will require higher taxes, hurting economic incentives and weakening economic activity. And the persistence of large deficits reduces the room that government have to increase spending when there is an economic downturn or a threat to national security.
 Reducing deficits is obviously a task for those responsible for tax revenue and public spending: governments and legislatures. But central banks also play a role, affecting the problem in two ways. Low-interest-rate policies in advanced countries are depressing the current size ofbudget deficits, but at the cost of reducing pressure on political leaders to address future deficits and encouraging voters to favor more spending programs and larger tax cuts. Central banks can help by announcing clearly that interest rates will rise substantially in the future, making it more expensive for government to borrow and to roll over existing debt.
 Reducing annual deficits requires either increased tax revenue or decreased outlays. Raising marginal tax rates is both politically unpopular and economically damaging. In the US, there is scope to raise revenue without increasing tax rates, by limiting so-called tax expenditures ? the forms of spending that are built into the tax rules rather than appropriated annually by Congress.
 For example, an American who buys an electric car receives a $7,000 tax reduction. Larger tax expenditures in the US include the deduction for mortgage interest and the exclusion from taxable income ofemployer-paid health-insurance premiums.
 Although eliminating any of these major tax expenditures might be politically impossible, limiting the amount by which a taxpayer could reduce his or her tax liability by using these provisions could raise substantial revenue. So I do my best to persuade my Republican friends in Congress that reducing the revenue loss from tax expenditures is really a way to cut government spending even though the deficit reduction appears on the revenue side of the budget.
 The good news is that a relatively small reduction in annual deficits can put an economy on a path to a much lower debt-to-GDP ratio. For the US, cutting the deficit from the projected 4.9% of GDP to 3% of GDP would cause the debt ratio to drop toward 60%.
 The same is true elsewhere. The long-run debt-to-GDP ratio is equal to the ratio of the annual budget deficit to the annual rate of growth of nominal GDP. With 4% nominal GDP growth, a budget deficit of 2% would bring the long-term debt ration down to 50%. That should be the goal for which all of the G7 countries aim.

How the West Was Lost
 Recent political discourse on both sides of the Atlantic has raised a distrurbing question that is becoming increasingly difficult to dismiss: Are the United States and Europe turning away from the policies of openness that have historically driven their economic success?
 In the US, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president is waging verbal war against virtually every trade agreement his country has ever struck. He has threatened to tear up the highly successful North American Free Trade Agreement and pledged to block any attempt to move forward with the Democratic Party, which has had to contend with skeptical voices from the trade unions that make up part of its constituency. 
Meanwhile, Trump’s likely opponent in the general election, Hillary Clinton, seems t have folded the flag and adopted at least part of the anti-trade tirades of Trump and her left-wing primary opponent, Bernie Sanders. Suddenly, she has turned against the TPP agreement, despite having supported it previously. She is opposing Us President Barack Obama’s tentative plan to have it ratified by Congress immediately after the November election.
This behavior is without precedent. Never before have the leading contenders for the US presidency fueled fears that free trade will undermine America’s prosperity. Whichever candidate prevails in November, the consequences are likely to be serious.
 In Europe, the situation is only marginally better. Austria’s entire political spectrum has come out firmly against the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership(TTIP) between the US and the European Union. And public opinion seems to be undergoing a similar shift in Germany, a country that owes its affluence to its success in global markets. Even in the Netherlands, which used to have free trade in its DNA(and would hardly exist without it), vocal campaigners are threatening to hold a referendum to reject any trans-Atlantic trade deal.
Given the history of the West these are perplexing developments. Europe’s rise began when its ships started to explore the world for new markets and opportunities. This underpinned not only rising wealth, but also innovation. To open up markets, after all, is also to open up minds.

 Similarly, in the decades since the end of World War2, the security of the West has been built first and foremost on the economic success of the US, Western Europe, and Japan ? success that was driven by integration, trade, and innovation. According to nearly every indicator one can think of, the remarkable growth in trade during the past quarter-century has given mankind some of its best decades ever.
 That is why it’s impossible to imagine achieving ambitious global development goals without placing free trade and globalization at the center of the strategy. If the West, losing faith in itself, turns away from very practices that made it successful, where does that leave poor and developing countries?
 Fortunately, all is not yet lost. But rescuing the West’s trade agenda will require exceptional leadership and perseverance. This will be a decisive year. The trade agreements involving the US, Asia, and Europe are important not just in terms of traditional goods, but also in terms of the free flow of data. While trade in physical goods is showing signs of stagnation, data flows have increased by a factor of 45 during the last decade.
 If Obama can ensure the ratification of the TPP and bring the TTIP negotiations to a conclusion, he will have laid the groundwork for future progress. If he falls short on either task ? or,, catastrophically, fails on both ? the world will face a far more uncertain future.
 Political leaders who still believe in the West must dedicate themselves to the defense of free trade and the construction of an ever more open world. They must do everything they can to prevent the introduction of protectionist measures and the erection of barriers to globalization.

Reconciling with Sykes-Picot
 This month marks the centenary of the Sykes-Picot Agreement the secret British-French accord that launched a decade-long series of adjustments to the borders of the post-Ottoman Middle East. Most commentary on the anniversary has been negative, suggesting that the agreement bears considerable blame for the frequency and durability of the region’s conflicts.
 That interpretation, however, borders on caricature. Mark Sykes and Francois Georges-Picot aimed to devise a plan that would enable Great Britain and France to avoid a ruinous rivalry in the Middle East. They largely succeeded: Their design kept the region from coming between the two European powers, and it managed to survive for a century.

The Limits of Oil’s Rebound
For the first time since last October, the price of a barrel of oil has broken through $50. It seems a good time to update the analysis I presented in January 2015.
 Back then, I argued that $50 or thereabouts would turn out to be a long-term ceiling for the oil price. At the time, with crude prices still above $60 almost everyone believed that %50 would be the rock-bottom floor. After all, futures markets predicted prices of $75 or higher; the Saudi and Russian governments needed $100 to balance their budgets; and any price much below $50 was considered unsustainable, because it would put the US shale-oil industry out of business.
 As it happened, the price of Brent crude did fluctuate between $50 and $70 in the first half of last year, before plunging decisively below $50 in early August, when it became obvious that the lifting of sanctions against Iran would unleash a massive increase in global supply. Since then, $50 has indeed proved to be a ceiling for the oil price. But now that this level has been exceeded, will it again become a floor?
 That seems to be what many investors are expecting. Hedge funds and other “non-commercial” speculators have increased their long positions to an all-time high of 555,000 of the main oil contracts traded on the New York futures market, compared to the previous record of 548,000 contracts, set just before the oil price peaked at $120 in June 2014. The return of speculative enthusiasm is usually a reliable sign that the next big price move will probably be down. More important, the fundamental arguments are more compelling than ever that $50 or thereabouts will continue to be a price ceiling, rather than a floor.

Siri is due for a big upgrade
Apple now has the tech in place to give its digital assistant a big boost thanks to a UK-based company called VocalIQ it bought last year.
 According to a source familiar with VocalIQ’s product, it’s much more robust and capable than Siri’s biggest competitors like Google Now, Amazon’s Alexa, and Micriosoft’s Cortana. In fact, it was so impressive that Apple bought VocalIQ before the company could finish and release its smrtphone app. After the acquisition, Apple kept most of the VocalIQ team and let them work out of their Cambridge office and integrate the product into Siri.
 Before Apple bought the company, VocalIQ tested its product against Siri, Google Now, and Cortana, and the results were impressive. Users asked each AI questions using normal language, not the robotic commands you’re used to using with digital assistants. Those commands can be long and complicated, and the other assistants had trouble catching everything.
 For example, imagine asking a computer to “Find a nearby Chinese restaurant with open parking and WiFi that’s kid-friendly.” That’d trip up most assistants, but VocalIQ could handle it. The result? VocalIQ’s success rate was over 90%, while Google Now, Siri, and Cortana were only successful about 20% of the time, according to one source.

confronting the Global Threat to Democracy
 Across the world, populists are attracting votes with their promises to protect ordinary people from the harsh realities of globalization. The democratic establishment, they assert, cannot be trusted to fulfill this purpose, as it is too busy protecting the wealthy ? a habit that globalization has only intensified.
 For decades globalization promised to bring benefits to all. On an international scale, it facilitated the rise of the Asian tigers and the BRICS countries(Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) produced rapid growth across Africa, and facilitated the boom in developed countries through 2007. It also created new opportunities and augmented growth within countries. But since the 2008 crach, many rich countries have been locked into austerity; the Asian economies have been slowing; the BRICS’ progress has been stalling; and many African countries have fallen back into debt.
 All of this has contributed to rising inequality, which is now fueling discontent. Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman calculate that in the United States, the wealth gap is already wider than at any time since the Great depression, with the richest 1% of households now holding almost half thecountry’s wealth.
 In the United Kingdom the Office for National Statistics reports that in the period from 2012to 2014, the wealthiest 10% of households owned 45% of total aggregate household wealth. Since July 2010, the top decile’s wealth has increased three times faster than that of the bottom 50% of the population.
 In Nigeria, astonishing economic growth, averaging 7% per year since 2000, may well have reduced poverty in the southwest of the country; but in the northeast (where the extremist group Boko haram is most active), shocking levels of wealth inequality and poverty have emerged. Similar trends are apparent from China to Egypt to Greece.

 Nobody is immune to the consequences of an economic crisis. But some are much more vulnerable ? and suffer far worse ? than others.
 Young people have been the main losers of the Great Recession brought on by the 2008 global financial crisis ? and not just in the advanced world. Millions have been pushed into highly unstable jobs, comdemned to indefinite unemployment, or forced to move abroad in search of bette opportunities. As Jean Pisani-Ferry of France Strategie, a French government advisory body points out, it is “much worse to be young today than it was a quarter-century ago.”
 Indeed so. The International Labor Organization estimates that, worldwide, 73 million people aged 16-24 were unemployed in 2014. That number has fallen from 76.6 million in 2009, when the impact of the 2008 crisis was still fresh; but the pace of improvement is not exactly encouraging. Simply put, around 45% of the world’s economically active young people are either unemployed or are living in poverty, depite having a job. And, given inadequate statistical reporting in many poor countries,, where populations tend to be younge, these figures almost certainly underestimate the severity of the problem.

Everyone knows there is no gain without pain. But there can be pain without gain ? a lesson that Western populations have been learning the hard way since at least 2012. With years of fiscal austerity in the United States, Europe, and Japan having achieved nothing, it is time for governments to start spending again.
The proposal will be met with outrage from many governments, especially, but not exclusively, Germany’s, and will be dismissed by the many political candidates who treat sovereign debt, built up by the incumbents they are seeking to depose, as the devil’s work. But beyond ideology and self-interest lies a simple and unavoidable truth: austerity is not working.

What about Google cloud Platform?
 When it comes to performance and networks, nobody can compete with Google Cloud Platform, so the pay-as-you trend ought to allow them to dominate the public cloud business. So why is it struggling?
 “Google can compete at a price point that is hard to beat, and hs created a lot of downward prince pressure on the market.” say McFadin, who thinks the web search giant is splipping up on its go-to-market plans. “It still treats cloud computing like a retail experience and hasn’t quite understood the enterprise market.” he says on the subject of why the big companies are so far staying away.
 Google Cloud Platform, which integrates perfectly with Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Storage, Google App Engine and Google Cloud SQL, is used by Snapchat, TiVo, Citrix, Ubisoft and Costco. It’s behind AWS on features, but is expected to catch up in the next few years. Google mostly has its eye on the banking industry, which is yet to embrace the public cloud.
 What about IBM Bluemix?
 Meanwhile, data centre giant IBM is pushing a hybrid and private cloud via Bluemax (for developers, and growing fast) and Watson ( a dash of cognitive and artificial intelligence that gives a unique appeal), though it is IBM’s less radical approach that gives it a unique appeal to companies who still aren’t sure whether to totally commit to the public cloud. Customers include Ethiad, EVRY, Finnair, ANZ, Columbia pipeline and Hootsuite, though Bluemix is aimed to squarely at developers and startups.
 Rackspace and others ? but one challenger is particularly scary to the incumbents. Chinese internet giant Alibaba has just opened a vast data centre in the US through its cloud computing arm Aliyun ? it wants a chunk of the massive and fast-growing global public cloud market.

 Sk C&C has forged a partnership with IBM over artificial intelligence(AI), focusing on raising awareness of the latter’s Watson AI supercomputer in Korea. Under the deal, both companies said Monday they will launch their official Korean-language-based Watson service as early as next year, giving local IT firms easy access to the cognitive computing system. At the center of the partnership is training Watson to understand Korean, which they said would significantly improve the nation’s data-based AI ecosystem.
“Our strategic alliance with SK holdings C&C will put cognitive services in the hands of more businesses and developers, allowing them to apply Watson within their organization to help transform entire industries and professions.” said David Kenny, IBM Watson’s general manager.
 By adding Korean, IBM has increased the system’s conversational languages to eight - which currently includes English, French, Spanish and Japanese. “The Korean marketplace is moving quickly to embrace the disruptive opportunities from next-generation technology.” Kenny said. “The two companies will foster a strong developer community, integrating cognitive computing into its business ideas.”
 The companies said the partnership will allow them to establish a fund with millions of dollars to support an education- and developer-focused AI environment.
 SK C&C CEO Park Jung-ho said: “The alliance highlights Sk’s dedication to growing our AI-based data service business and strengthening our AI leadership, as well as spurring innovation and AI adoption across the nation.”
 This is the first time a Korean company has partnered with one of the industry-leading AI business giants. SK C&C is a system integration affiliate of SK Group.

Innovation Is Not Enough(1)
 We seem to be living in an accelerated age of revolutionary technological breakthroughs. Barely a day passes without the announcement of some major new development in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, digitization, or automation. Yet those who are supposed to know where it is all taking us can’t make up their minds.
 At one end of the spectrum are the techno-optimists, who believe we are on the cusp of a new era in which the world’s standards will rise more rapidly than ever. At the other end are the techno-pessimists, who see disappointing productivity statistics and argue that the new technologies’ economy-wide benefits will remain limited. Then there are those ? the techno-worriers? ? who agree with the optimists about the scale and scope of innovation but fret about the adverse implications for employment or equity.
 What distinguished these perspectives from one another is not so much disagreement about the rate of technological innovation. After all, who can seriously doubt that innovation is progressing rapidly? The debate is about whether these innovations will remain bottled up in a few tech-intensive sectors that employ the highest-skilled professionals and account for a relatively small share of GDP, or spread to the bulk of the economy. The consequences of any innovation for productivity, employment, and equity ultimately depend on how quickly it diffuses through labor and product markets.

Innovation Is Not Enough(2)
 Technological diffusion can be constrained on both the demand and supply sides of the economy. Take the demand side first. In rich economies, consumers spend the bulk of their income on services such as health, education, transportation, housing and retail goods. Technological innovation has had comparatively little impact on to date in many of these sectors.
 Consider some of the figures provided by the McKinsey Global Institute’s recent report Digital America. The two sectors in the United States that have experienced the most rapid productivity growth since 2005 are the ICT(information and communications technology) and media industries, with a combined GDP share of less than 10%. By contrast, government services and health care, which together produce more than a quarter of GDP have had virtually no productivity growth.
 Techno-optimists, such as the McKinsey authors, look at such numbers as an opportunity: There remain vast productivity gains to be had from the adoption of new technologies in the lagging sectors. The pessimists, on the other hand, think that such gaps may be a structural, lasting feature of today’s economies. 
 For example, the economic historian Robert Gordon argues that today’s innovations pale in contrast to past technological revolutions in terms of their likely economy-wide impact. Electricity, the automobile, airplane, air conditioning, and household appliances altered the way that ordinary people live in fundamental ways. They made inroads in every sector of the economy. Perhaps the digital revolution, impressive as it has been, will not reach as far.

Breaking Asia’s Data Drought(1)
 Many parts of Asia have been gripped by searing temperature and the worst drought in decades. Millions of people face shortages of food or water, leading to the loss of lives, livelihoods, crops, and livestock. As water shortages depress productivity, reduce energy output at hydro plants, and cut food exports, economies are suffering.
 To find relief, we must look to the skies ? but not in the way one might expect. While rainfall would obviously be welcome, there is a tool for coping with extreme weather over which we actually have some control: satellites.
 The extreme weather confronting Asia is not expected to abate anytime soon. The current drought can be blamed partly on an unusually strong El Nino that has been warming the Pacific Ocean since mid-2015. More and stronger El Ninos are expected this century, reflecting the impact of climate change. This will aggravate Asia’s already serious water problem, which is becoming particularly serious in cities owing to rapid urbanization. The region’s urban population is set to double, to 3.2 billion people, by 2050, by which time nearly three-quarters of its total population could face water stress.
 Controlling these forces may seem impossible. But preventing further water shortages is not. What is needed now is bold action to improve our understanding of the nature and scale of Asia’s water crisis, thereby strengthening capacity to respond to it.

 A lack of data about, say riparian flows, including how much water is diverted for agriculture and human consumption, undermines efficient resource management. Likewise, the absence of detailed rainfall records, particularly in remote areas, impedes efforts to assess flood and drought risk. Accurate data are also needed to design the right irrigation systems, dams, and embankments not to mention building them where they will have the greatest impact in terms of mitigating the effects of climate change.
 Missing data frustrate sound policymaking in myriad ways. Though agriculture consumes about 80% of freshwater stock in Asia, most countries cannot correctly measure how much water is used to grow a crop and how much of that water is re-used downstream. Greater clarity about how much water enters and eaves catchments, and for what purposes, would enable smarter policies, just as savvy investors rely on good financial accounting. As some water-scarce countries, such as Australia, have already shown, such accounting helps countries to allocate water more efficiently among agriculture and energy producers and urban consumers.

 Here is where satellite technology comes in. Regular sweeps over cropped areas using remore sensing ? something like a full body health scan ? can quickly gather information on rainfall, land temperature, and even groundwater levels that would otherwise take months to obtain. When combined with physical measurements on the ground these data ca help governments gain a better accounting of water resources, prepare for droughts and floods, and plan future water use.

 Much such initiatives are needed ? and quickly. One area of focus must be agriculture. In Vietnam’s parched central highlands and coastal provinces, for example, there is an urgent need to harvest “more crop per drop” and improve emergency responses. If satellite technology is fully exploited, farmers could receive real-time information on their mobile phones about how much water to use and when. Moreover, the region’s most productive farmers could be identified and encouraged to share their best practice with other farmers.
 Another key step will be to map water stocks and usage across entire countries, and to make this information available online. Rather than allowing vital data to gather dust, as has occurred in the past, we must augment it, update it, and share it widely, so that it can be put to use.
 Breaking the data drought will not by itself end Asia’s water crisis. But it is a crucial first step to ensure that the region’s destiny is not dictated by its weather.

 It’s been less than a week since the deadliest mass shooting in American history. And foremost in all of our minds has been the loss and the grief felt by the people of Orlando, especially our friends who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. I visited with the families of many of the victims on Thursday. And one thing I told them is that they’re not alone. The American people and people all over the world, are standing with them ? and we always will.
 The investigation is ongoing, but we know that the killer was an angry and disturbed individual who took in extremist in information and propaganda over the internet, and became radicalized. During his killing spree, he pledged allegiance to ISIL, a group that’s called on people around the world to attack innocent civilians.
 We are and we will keep doing everything in our power to stop these kinds of attacks, and to ultimately destroy ISIL. The extraordinary people in our intelligence, military, homeland security, and law enforcement communities have already prevented many attacks, saved many lives, and we won’t let up.

 Alongside the stories of bravery and healing and coming together over the past week, we've also seen a renewed focus on reducing gun violence. As I said a fews days ago, being tough on terrorism requires more than talk. Being tough on terrorism, prticularly the sorts of homegrown terrorism that we've seen now in Orlando and San Bernardino, means making it harder for people who want to kill Americans to get their hands on assult weapons that are capable of killing dozens of innocents as qukckly as possible. That's something I'll continue to talk about in the weeks ahead.
 It's also part of something that I've been thinking a lot about this week - and that's the responsibilites we have to each other. That's certainly true with Father's Day upon us.
 I grew up without my father around. While I wonder what my life would have been like if he had been a greater presence, I've also tried extra hard to be a good dad for my own daughters. Like all dads, I worry about my girls's safety all the time. Especially when we see preventable violence in places our sons and daughter go every day - their schools and houses of worship, movie theater, nightclubs, as they get older. It's unconscionable that we allow easy access to weapons of war in these places - and then, even after we see parents grieve for their children, the fact that we as a country do nothing to prevent the next heartbreak makes no sense.

 So this past week, I've also thought a lot about dads and moms around the country who've had to explain to their children what happened in Orlando. Time and again, we've observed moments of silence for victims of terror and gun violence. Too often, those moments have been followed by months of silence. By inaction that is simply inexcusable. If we're going to raise our kids in a safer, more loving world, we need to speak up for it. We need out kids to hear us speak up about the risks guns pose to our communities, and against a status quo that doesn't make sense. They need to hear us say these things even when those who disagree are loud and are powerful. We need our kids to hear from us why tolerance and equality matter - about the times their absence has scared our history and how greater understanding will better the future they will inherit. We need our kids to hear our words - and also see us live our own lives with love.
 And we can't forget our responsibility to remind our kind of the role models whose light shines through in times of darkness. The police and first responders, the lifesaving bystanders and blood donors those who comport mourners and visit the wounded. The victims whose last acts on this earth helped others to safety. They're not just roles models for our kids - their action are examples for all of us.
 To be a parent is to come to realize not everything is in our control. But as parents, we should remember there's one responsibility that's always in our power to fulfill: our obligation to give our children unconditional love and support: to show them the difference between right and wrong; to teach them to love, not to hate; and to appreciate our differences notes something to fear, but as a great gift to cherish.
 To me, fatherhood means being there. So in the days ahead, let's be there for each other. Let's be therefor our families, and for those that are hurting. Let's come together in our communities and as a country. And let's never forget how much good we can achieve simply by loving one another.
 Happy Father's Day to all the dads out there, and have a great weekend

Hi, everybody. Today, I want to talk with you about the crisis in Puerto Rico ? and why it matters to all of us.   
 Puerto Ricans are American citizens, just like folks in Maine or Oklahoma or New Mexico.  And over the last decade, Puerto Rico has suffered through a deep and painful recession ? but unlike the rest of the United States, it hasn’t recovered.  
 Today, the island continues to face a crippling economic crisis.  Schools are closing.  Power is being cut off at homes and hospitals.  Teachers have to choose between turning on the lights or turning on the computers.  Doctors can’t get medicine to treat newborns unless they pay in cash.  And as the Zika virus threatens both the island and the mainland, workers dealing with mosquito control to help protect women and their unborn babies are at risk of being laid off.  
 Right now, Puerto Rico is spending about a third of its tax revenue on debt payments ? far more than anywhere else in America.  And on July 1, the island faces another $2 billion in debt payments that it cannot pay.


 Britain, I believe, had the best of all possible deals with the European Union, being a member of the common market without belonging to the euro and having secured a number of other opt-outs from EU rules. And yet that was not enough to stop the United Kingdom’s electorate from voting to leave. Why? 
 The answer could be seen in opinion polls in the months leading up to the “Brexit” referendum. The European migration crisis and the Berxit debate fed on each other. The “Leave” campaign exploited the deteriorating refugee situation ? symbolized by frightening images of thousands of asylum-seekers concentrating in Calais, desperate to enter Britain by any means necessary ? to stoke fear of “uncontrolled” immigration from other EU member states. And the European authorities delayed important decisions on refugee policy in order to avoid a negative effect on the British referendum vote, thereby perpetuating scenes of chaos like the one in Calais.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to open her country’s doors wide to refugees was an inspiring gesture, but it was not properly thought out, because it ignored the pull factor. A sudden influx of asylum-seekers disrupted people in their everyday lives across the EU.
The lack of adequate controls, moreover, created panic, affecting everyone: the local population, the authorities in charge of public safety, and the refugees themselves. It has also paved the way for the rapid rise of xenophobic anti-European parties ? such as the UK Independence Party, which spearheaded the Leave campaign ? as national governments and European institutions seem incapable of handling the crisis.

Britain’s Democratic Failure(1)

The real lunacy of the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union was not that British leaders dared to ask their populace to weigh the benefits of membership against the immigration pressures it presents. Rather, it was the absurdly low bar for exit, requiring only a simple majority. Given voter turnout of 70%, this meant that the leave campaign won with only 36% of eligible voters backing it.
 This isn’t democracy; it is Russian roulette for republics. A decision of enormous consequence ? far greater even than amending a country’s constitution (of course, the United Kingdom lacks a written one) ? has been made without any appropriate checks and balances.
 Does the vote have to be repeated after a year to be sure? No. Does a majority in Parliament have to support Brexit? Apparently not. Did the UK’s population really know what they were voting on? Absolutely not. Indeed, no one has any idea of the consequences, both for the UK in the global trading system, or the effect on domestic political stability. I am afraid it is not going to be a pretty picture.

Britain’s Democratic Failure(2)

 Mind you, citizens of the West are blessed to live in a time of peace: changing circumstances and priorities can be addressed through democratic processes instead of foreign and civil wars. But what, exactly, is a fair, democratic process for making irreversible, nation-defining decisions? Is it really enough to get 52% to vote for breakup on a rainy day?
 In terms of durability and conviction of preferences, most societies place greater hurdles in the way of a couple seeking a divorce than Prime Minister David Cameron’s government did on the decision to leave the EU. Brexiteers did not invent this game; there is ample precedent, including Scotland in 2014 and Quebec in 1995. But, until now, the gun’s cylinder never stopped on the bullet. Now that it has, it is time to rethink the rules of the game.
 The idea that somehow any decision reached anytime by majority rule is necessarily “democratic” is a perversion of the term. Modern democracies have evolved systems of checks and balances to protect the interests of minorities and to avoid making uninformed decisions with catastrophic consequences. The greater and more lasting the decision, the higher the hurdles.

Britain’s Democratic Failure(3)

That’s why enacting, say, a constitutional amendment generally requires clearing far higher hurdles than passing a spending bill. Yet the current international standard for breaking up a country is arguably less demanding than a vote for lowering the drinking age. 
 With Europe now facing the risk of a slew of further breakup votes, an urgent question is whether there is a better way to make these decisions. I polled several leading political scientists to see whether there is any academic consensus; unfortunately, the short answer is no.
 For one thing, the Brexit decision may have looked simple on the ballot, but in truth no one knows what comes next after a leave vote. What we do know is that, in practice, most countries require a “supermajority” for nation-defining decisions, not a mere 51%. There is no universal figure like 60%, but the general principle is that, at a bare minimum, the majority ought to be demonstrably stable. A country should not be making fundamental, irreversible changes based on a razor-thin minority that might prevail only during a brief window of emotion. Even if the UK economy does not fall into outright recession after this vote (the pound’s decline might cushion the initial blow), there is every chance that the resulting economic and political disorder will give some who voted to leave “buyers’ remorse.”

Britain’s Democratic Failure(4)




 Since ancient times, philosophers have tried to devise systems to try to balance the strengths of majority rule against the need to ensure that informed parties get a larger say in critical decisions, not to mention that minority voices are heard. In the Spartan assemblies of ancient Greece, votes were cast by acclamation. People could modulate their voice to reflect the intensity of their preferences, with a presiding officer carefully listening and then declaring the outcome. It was imperfect, but maybe better than what just happened in the UK.
 By some accounts, Sparta’s sister state, Athens, had implemented the purest historical example of democracy. All classes were given equal votes (albeit only males). Ultimately, though, after some catastrophic war decisions, Athenians saw a need to give more power to independent bodies.
 What should the UK have done if the question of EU membership had to be asked (which by the way, it didn’t)? Surely, the hurdle should have been a lot higher; for example, Brexit should have required, say, two popular votes spaced out over at least two years, followed by a 60% vote in the House of Commons. If Brexit still prevailed, at least we could know it was not just a one-time snapshot of a fragment of the population.
 The UK vote has thrown Europe into turmoil. A lot will depend on how the world reacts and how the UK government manages to reconstitute itself. It is important to take stock not just of the outcome, though, but of the process. Any action to redefine a long-standing arrangement on a country’s borders ought to require a lot more than a simple majority in a one-time vote. The current international norm of simple majority rule is, as we have just seen, a formula for chaos.

How EU Overreach Pushed Britain out(1)

CAMBRIDGE ? A thoughtful British friend of mine said to me a few days before the United Kingdom’s “Brexit” referendum that he would vote for Remain because of his concern about the economic uncertainty that would follow if the UK left the European Union. But he added that he would not have favored Britain’s decision to join the EU back in 1973 had he known then how the EU would evolve.
 While voters chose Leave for a variety of reasons, many were concerned with the extent to which EU leaders have exceeded their original mandate, creating an ever larger and more invasive organization.
 Jean Monnet’s dream of a United States of Europe was not what the British wanted when they joined the EU 40 years ago. Nor were they seeking a European counterweight to the United States, as Konrad Adenauer, Germany’s first post-war chancellor, had once advocated. Britain simply wanted the advantages of increased trade and labor-market integration with countries across the English Channel.

How EU Overreach Pushed Britain out(2)

 The EU began as an agreement among six countries to achieve free trade in goods and capital and to eliminate barriers to labor mobility. When EU leaders sought to reinforce a sense of European solidarity by establishing a monetary union, Britain was fortunately able to opt out and keep the pound ? and control over its monetary policy. But the opt-out has left Britain a relative outsider within the EU.
 As the EU expanded from six countries to 28, Britain could not permanently limit entry to its labor market by workers from the new member states. As a result, the number of foreign-born workers in Britain has doubled since 1993, to more than six million, or 10% of the labor force, with most now coming from low-wage countries that were not among the EU’s other original members.
 
Although pro-Brexit voters worry about the resulting pressure on UK wages, they generally do not reject the original goals of increased trade and capital flows that are the essence of globalization. Some Brexit defenders could point to the example of the successful US free-trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, which contains no provision for labor mobility.

Martin Feldstein
How EU Overreach Pushed Britain out(3)


Unlike Britain, the other EU countries, led by France and Germany, wanted more than free trade and an enlarged labor market. From the start, European leaders were determined to expand the “European project” to achieve what the Treaty of Rome called an “ever closer union.” Advocates of shifting authority to EU institutions have justified this with the notion of “shared sovereignty,” according to which British sovereignty could be eroded by EU decisions, without any formal agreement from the UK’s government or people.
 The “Stability and Growth Pact” of 1998 imposed a limit on member countries’ annual deficits and required that debt-to-GDP ratios shrink toward a maximum of 60%. When the global financial crisis began in 2008, German Chancellor Angela Merkel saw an opportunity to strengthen the EU even further, by enforcing a new “fiscal compact” authorizing the European Commission to oversee members’ annual budgets and impose fines for violating budget and debt targets (though no fines have been levied). Germany also led the move to establish a European “banking union” with a single regulatory framework and a binding resolution mechanism for troubled financial institutions.
 Not all of these policies directly affected the UK; nonetheless, they widened the intellectual and political gap between Britain and the EU’s eurozone members. That reinforced the fundamental difference between market-oriented British governments and those of many EU countries, with their traditions of socialism, government planning, and heavy regulation.

The Brexit Alarm(1)

As a passionate European, the outcome of Britain’s referendum on European Union membership horrified me. It will almost certainly result in our exit from the EU. But I have feared for many years that large-scale immigration to the UK would produce a harmful populist response.
 Global elites must now learn and act upon the crucial lesson of “Brexit.” Contrary to glib assumptions, globalization of capital, trade, and migration flows is not “good for everyone.” If we do not address its adverse effects, Brexit will not be the last ? or the worst ? consequence.
 Net immigration to Britain was close to zero in the early 1990s. It began to increase later that decade, and grew rapidly after eight formerly communist countries joined the EU in 2004, when Britain ? unlike, for instance, France and Germany ? waived its right to impose a seven-year delay before allowing free movement of people from the new member states. Last year, net immigration was 333,000, and the total population grew by around 500,000. Credible forecasts suggest that the UK’s population, now 64 million, could be above 80 million by mid-century.

44일차
Andair Turner
The Brexit Alarm(2)

 Migration undoubtedly brings many benefits ? London is a wonderful city partly because it is a cosmopolitan melting pot of diverse cultures. But, as the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, of which I was then a member, argued as early as 2008, large-scale immigration has brought significant disadvantages for many people.
 The precise impact of migration on wages is hotly debated among economists, but no economy can face a sudden surge in labor supply without some adverse consequences for at least some groups of “native” workers. A sudden surge in population, often concentrated in particular locations, will also produce overcrowding in key public services, such as education and health care, unless offset by a well-planned and well-financed surge in public investment. In the UK, that investment did not occur.
 In England ? which vies with the Netherlands for the highest population density in Europe ? many fear that further population growth will mean unwelcome pressure on much-loved countryside. This has provoked intense local opposition to major new infrastructure development, with endless delay, increased cost, or lasting resentment the inevitable result.
 For all these reasons, increased migration to the UK was bound to produce a political reaction. That reaction partly reflected xenophobia, fanned by deliberate exaggeration: “Leave” campaigners, for example, mendaciously suggested that Turkey, with its large and rapidly expanding population, would soon enter the EU without Britain’s consent. But the lies were effective because they built on a kernel of truth, and because refusing to recognize that truth only intensified the populist reaction.

Why Climate Change Is an Education Issue(1)

Climate change affects us all, but we still are not acting as quickly as we should to address its causes, mitigate the damage, and adapt to its effects. Many people don’t understand the risks climate change poses to global economic and social structures. And, sadly, many who do understand are dismissive of the far-reaching benefits a global shift to sustainability and clean energy would bring about.
 According to a recent Pew study, seven out of ten Americans classified as political independents were not very concerned that climate change would hurt them. Worse still, Yale University researchers recently found that 40% of adults worldwide have never even heard of climate change. In some developing countries, such as India, that figure climbs to 65%.
 These figures are discouraging, but they can be improved. The Yale study concluded that, “educational attainment tends to be the single strongest predictor of public awareness of climate change.” By investing in quality education, we can set the next generation on the right path to addressing this global problem.

Felipe Calderon
Why Climate Change Is an Education Issue(2)

 Education and climate action work together in three ways. For starters, education fills knowledge gaps. Understanding how climate change is already having an impact on one’s life can have practical benefits. This is especially true for poor populations that are most vulnerable to crop failures and natural disasters, such as landslides and floods, caused by climate change. Populations that must rebuild from scratch after each new catastrophe miss out on opportunities for rapid development. By understanding that their world is changing ? and that the likelihood of future disasters is increasing ? these populations can build resilience and learn to adapt to the sudden and slow stresses of a changing climate.
 Second, education challenges apathy. Knowing the measures available to address climate change can open up vast opportunities for economic growth. Global investors should be made to understand that sustainable solutions can increase wellbeing and create additional economic opportunities. To take one example, in Niger, education and improved farming techniques helped double real farm incomes for more than one million people, while restoring huge tracts of severely degraded land. In the US, as of 2014, there were more jobs that depended on solar energy than on coal mining.

 Once again, young people have gotten the short end of the political stick. The outcome of the United Kingdom’s Brexit referendum is but another reminder of a yawning generational divide that cuts across political affiliation, income levels, and race.
 Almost 75% of UK voters aged 18-24 voted to “Remain” in the European Union, only to have “Leave” imposed on them by older voters. And this is just one of several ways in which millennials’ economic future, and that of their children, is being determined by others.

In the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis, we feasted on leverage, feeling increasingly entitled to use credit to live beyond our means and to assume too much speculative financial risk. We stopped investing in genuine engines of growth, letting our infrastructure decay, our education system lag, and our worker training and retooling programs erode.
 We allowed the budget to be taken hostage by special interests, which has resulted in a fragmentation of the tax system that, no surprise, has imparted yet another unfair anti-growth bias to the economic system. And we witnessed a dramatic worsening in inequality, not just of income and wealth, but also of opportunity.

Unburdening the Facebook Generation(3)

The 2008 crisis should have been our economic wake-up call. It wasn’t. Rather than using the crisis to catalyze change, we essentially rolled over and went back to doing more of the same.
Specifically, we simply exchanged private factories of credit and leverage for public ones. We swapped an over-leveraged banking system for experimental liquidity injections by hyperactive monetary authorities. In the process, we overburdened central banks, risking their credibility and political autonomy, as well as future financial stability.

Unburdening the Facebook Generation(4)

 Emerging from the crisis, we shifted private liabilities from banks’ balance sheets to taxpayers, including future ones, yet we failed to fix fully the bailed-out financial sector. We let inequality worsen, and stood by as too many young people in Europe languished in joblessness, risking a scary transition from unemployment to unemployability.
 In short, we didn’t do nearly enough to reinvigorate the engines of sustainable inclusive growth, thereby also weakening potential output and threatening future economic performance. And we are compounding these serial miscarriages with a grand failure to act on longer-term sustainability, particularly when it comes to the planet and social cohesion.
 Poor economics has naturally spilled over into messy politics, as growing segments of the population have lost trust in the political establishment, business elites, and expert opinion. The resulting political fragmentation, including the rise of fringe and anti-establishment movements, has made it even harder to devise more appropriate economic-policy responses.

To add insult to injury, we are now permitting a regulatory backlash against technological innovations that disrupt entrenched and inefficient industries, and that provide people with greater control over their lives and wellbeing.

If we do not change course soon, subsequent generations will confront self-reinforcing economic, financial, and political tendencies that burden them with too little growth, too much debt, artificially inflated asset prices, and alarming levels of inequality and partisan political polarization. Fortunately, we are aware of the mounting problem, worried about its consequences, and have a good sense of how to bring about the much-needed pivot.

Innovation and Its Discontents

 Technological innovation is often extolled for its power to overcome major development challenges, fuel economic growth, and propel societies forward. Yet innovations frequently face high barriers to implementation, with governments sometimes banning new technologies outright ? even those that could bring far-reaching benefits.
 Consider the printing press. Among other things, the new technology was a boon to world religions, which suddenly had an efficient means of reproducing and disseminating sacred texts. Yet the Ottoman Empire forbade the printing of the Koran for nearly 400 years. In 1515, Sultan Selim I is said to have decreed that “occupying oneself with the science of printing was punishable by death.”
 Why oppose such a beneficial technology? As I argue in my book Innovation and Its Enemies: Why People Resist New Technologies, the answer is not simply that people are afraid of the unknown. Rather, resistance to technological progress is usually rooted in the fear that disruption of the status quo might bring losses in employment, income, power, and identity. Governments often end up deciding that it would be easier to prohibit the new technology than to adapt to it.

인공지능 씨앗 한글 말뭉치, 2007년 멈춰선 까닭
http://www.bloter.net/archives/260569

 자연어 처리는 인공지능 기술에서 중요한 축을 담당한다. 인간의 말을 인식해 메시지를 분석하고 다시 답변을 내놓으려면 자연어를 처리할 수 있는 향상된 기술이 필요하다. 현재 많은 연구들이 인간의 눈을 대체하는 ‘비전 인식’에 몰두하고 있다. 이미지나 영상을 기계가 인식해 사물을 분별하고 나누고 예측하는 다양한 기술들이 선보이고 있다.
 인간의 입과 귀를 보완하거나 대신하기 위한 연구도 한창이긴 하다. 애플이 시리나 썸리와 같은 기사 요약 서비스 등이 여기에 해당한다. 번역에서도 자연어 처리는 필수적이다. 하지만 비전 인식에 비해 더딜 수밖에 없다. 문자 언어가 깊숙이 관여돼있기 때문이다.
 기계가 인간의 언어를 인식하기 위해서는 인간이 수천년 간 사용한 문자 언어를 ‘통달’해야 한다. 특히나 한국어를 이해하려면 한글이라는 언어의 역사적 굴곡까지도 파악해낼 수 있어야 한다. 이를테면, 현대 한글뿐 아니라 고어, 심지어 사자성어와 같은 자주 쓰는 한자어도 인식할 수 있어야 한다.
 방언도 예외일 순 없다. 로봇의 모양을 한 인공지능 로봇이 제주에 거주하는 고령층의 대화를 인식하기 위해서는 제주어에 대한 데이터베이스가 갖춰져야 한다. 언어의 역사와 사회성에 대한 방대한 학습이 전제돼야 한다는 얘기다.
 말뭉치(코퍼스)가 뭘까?
 자연어 처리의 가장 밑단, 즉 기단부 역할을 하는 게 한글 말뭉치다. 이를 개발용어로는 코퍼스(Corpus)라고 부른다. 한글 말뭉치는 쉽게 말하면 한글 어휘와 어휘 특성의 저장소다. 디지털 사전에 비유될 수 있지만 그보단 복잡하다.

일반적으로 문서를 디지털화한 뒤 해당 문서에 사용된 모든 어휘를 문장, 어절, 형태소별로 추려내고 각각에 특성을 부여한다. 뿐만 아니라 동사의 경우 다양한 활용형태, 예를 들어 감사합니다, 감사하다, 감사해요? 등과 결과치들을 데이터베이스화 한다. 이동주(2010) 등은 “말뭉치는 분석 결과가 태그로 부착된 파일들의 집합”이라고 했다.
 말뭉치는 텍스트분석이든 인공지능이든 언어 분석이든 개발과 연구를 위해 반드시 갖춰져야 할 디지털 데이터베이스다. 하지만 구축에 상당한 비용이 든다. 방대한 오프라인 문서를 디지털화한 뒤 일일이 태깅하는 작업이 필요하기에 초기 구축비용이 어마어마하다.
 말뭉치 구축 범위를 어디까지 확장하느냐도 비용에 직접적으로 미치는 요인이다. 고어나 방언, 북한 언어까지 포함하게 되면 민간이 접근하긴 쉽지 않아진다. 결과적으로 한글 말뭉치 구축 작업은 공공 영역이 개입할 수밖에 없다. 그 결과물 또한 저작권으로 묶어두기 어려워 커먼스로 풀어야만 한다.

인공지능 씨앗 한글 말뭉치, 2007년 멈춰선 까닭
http://www.bloter.net/archives/260569
 
 민간이 개발하기엔 너무나도 큰 비용
 정부는 한글 말뭉치의 이 같은 성격 때문에 상당한 비용을 들여 프로젝트를 추진했다. 대표적인 사업이 21세기 세종 프로젝트다. 국립국어원은 1998년부터 2007년까지 150억원의 예산을 투입해 이 프로젝트를 완료했다. 여기엔 세종 말뭉치라는 한글 말뭉치 사업이 포함돼있었다. 그것도 무려 2억 어절에 해당하는 방대한 구축 작업이었다. 이는 영국이나 미국, 일본에 뒤지지 않는 규모로 평가됐다.
 그렇게 탄생한 세종 말뭉치는 자연어 처리 분야에서 다양하게 활용되고 있다. 대표적으로는 서울대에서 개발한 꼬꼬마 세종 말뭉치 활용 시스템이다. 세종 말뭉치를 데이터베이스에 저장해 웹 프로그램 형태로 구현한 사례다. 말뭉치 통계 정보 조회, 말뭉치 검색, 한국어 쓰기 학습의 세 가지의 기능을 갖추고 있다.
 일본어 형태소 분석기 엔진에 세종 말뭉치를 학습해 한국형 형태소 분석기로 탄생한 사례도 있다. 은전한닢 프로젝트에 따라 개발된 ‘mecab-ko’ 형태소 분석기다. ‘mecab-ko‘는 세종 말뭉치에서 2만여 문장을 가져와 분석 엔진을 학습시켰다.
 자연어 처리에 광범위하게 활용되던 세종 말뭉치는 2007년 기점으로 업데이트가 사실상 중단됐다. 더 이상 제2의 21세기 세종 프로젝트가 진행되지 않고 있는 탓이다. 10년이 지나는 동안 수많은 인터넷 신조어가 탄생하고 있고 광범위하게 일상에 활용되고 있지만 세종 말뭉치에는 반영이 되지 않는다. 비교적 변화가 적은 언어 유형은 상관이 없지만 구어와 같은 메신저 용어 등은 세종 말뭉치에서 품사 구별조차 하지 못하는 실정이다.

세종 말뭉치 사업을 주도하고 관리하고 있는 국립국어원도 아쉬워하기는 마찬가지다. 최정도 국립국어원 학예사는 “국립국어원에서 말뭉치를 만들어서 배포하고 싶지만 지속적으로 지원이 안되는 측면이 있다”고 했다. 그는 “예산을 따서 하고 싶지만 어려운 측면이 있다”고도 했다. 그는 “최신 것들이 코퍼스에 들어와야 하고 구성면에서도 IT와 관련해서 등장하는 단어들을 찾고 싶다면 구성도 잘해야 한다”라며 “하지만 현실적으로 여의치가 않다”고 말했다.
 정부가 ’한국형 알파고‘니 하며 인공지능 사업에 1조원의 예산을 투입할 기세지만 한글 말뭉치 사업과 같은 구체적인 항목은 아직 포함되지 않은 상태다.
 한국 말뭉치 업그레이드가 단절되면 자연어처리 기술로 인공지능 시장에 진입하고자 하는 스타트업이 부담이 된다. 당장 IT 대기업과 이 분야에서 간극을 좁히기가 어렵다. 네이버와 같은 IT 대기업들은 이미 십수년 간 수집한 뉴스 문서, 기타 블로그와 전문 자료들을 광범위하게 확보해 정교한 말뭉치를 자체적으로 구축해왔다. 오랜 공을 들여 구축한 말뭉치이기에 공개하기도 어렵다. 반면 스타트업이 이에 준하는 수준으로 말뭉치를 구축하기는 비용 문제로 사실상 불가능하다. 말뭉치라는 디지털 커먼스가 공공에서 제공돼야 할 이유이기도 하다.
 학계는 웹 서비스화 돼 있는 전문 말뭉치를 사용하면 된다. 고려대 민족문화연구원이 구축한 ’물결 21‘은 대학연구소가 개발한 최대 규모의 디지털 말뭉치다. 국내 4대 일간지의 14년치(2001년~2014년) 6억 어절의 문서가 분석돼있다. 이 서비스를 이용하면 언어 연구에 필요한 결과를 다양한 형태로 받아갈 수 있다(최재웅&이도길. 2014).
 그러나 이 말뭉치는 한계도 있다. 외부 형태소 분석기과 결합해 사용하기 어렵다는 점이다. 세종 말뭉치와 달리 소스 파일이 공개돼있지 않아서다. 일반적으로 기분석 사전과 형태소 분석기를 통합하면 높은 정확도와 효율성을 만들어낼 수 있다. 곽수정(2013) 등은 “기분석 사전은 대용량의 품사 부착 말뭉치의 고빈도 어절로 구축되어 형태소 분석기의 속도를 향상시키기 위해 사용돼왔다”고 적고 있다. 기분석 사전을 구축하려면 기존 말뭉치가 필요한데, 소스 파일이 공개되지 않아 두 시스템을 결합하기 어려운 것이다.
 연세대 말뭉치, 카이스트 코퍼스 등 공개된 말뭉치가 없지는 않지만 규모로 따지면 세종 말뭉치나 물결21에 비할 바는 못된다. 말뭉치는 공공이 개입해 커먼스로 구축하기에 적합한 모델이라고 할 수 있다.
 디지털 커먼스로서 한글 말뭉치와 공공의 역할
 언어는 끊임없이 변화한다. 신조어 탄생하는가 하면 일부 어휘는 사멸하기도 한다. 예전 단어에 새로운 의미가 부여되는가 하면 단어와 단어의 새로운 결합이 나타나 전혀 다른 용례로 쓰이기도 한다. 말뭉치는 이처럼 역동적인 언어의 변동에 대응할 수 있어야 한다. 자연어 처리를 기반으로 하는 인공지능 기술은 역동성에 대응하는 말뭉치의 힘에 의존할 수밖에 없다.
 문제는 막대한 비용이 투입되는 말뭉치를 누가 구축할 것이냐이다. 말뭉치 구축은 따지면 기초연구에 해당한다. 비용은 많이 들지만 곧장 수익이 나지 않는 사업이다. 그것의 공적 가치는 무한하지만 그 자체의 상업적 가치는 제한적일 수밖에 없다. 2007년 이후로 멈춰버린 세종 한글 말뭉치, 인공지능 기술이 부상하는 현재 국면에서 여전히 외면받고 있는 현실이 안타까울 수밖에 없다.

“하이퍼루프 2020년 상용화? 솔직히 이르다”

 2013년 일론 머스크가 하이퍼루프 아이디어를 공개할 당시, 일론 머스크가 내건 이상적인 미래 교통수단의 조건이다. 머스크는 이 아이디어 문서에서 캘리포니아 주당국의 차세대 고속철도 프로젝트가 “너무 느리다”고 비판했다. 게다가 비용이 너무 많이 들어 비효율적이라고도 언급했다. 그 이후 미래 대안적 교통수단으로 하이퍼루프 개발은 미국을 중심으로 본격화하기 시작했다.
 현재 하이퍼루프 개발을 주도하고 있는 대표적인 기업은 하이퍼루프원과 HTT, 트랜스포드 세 곳이다. 일부 언론들은 이들 기업이 일론 머스크가 직접 창업한 기업이라고 보도하고 있지만, 명백히 별개 회사다. 단지, 창업자들과 일론 머스크가 친분이 두터울 뿐이다. 일론 머스크가 소유한 스페이스X는 현재 ‘하이퍼루프 포드 콤퍼티션’을 개최하고 있을 뿐 직접적으로 개발 사업에 뛰어들지는 않은 상태다.
 최근 들어 시스코 출신의 롭 로이드가 CEO로 있는 하이퍼루프원의 움직임이 도드라진다. 하이퍼루프원은 지난 5월 네바다주 사막에서 프로토타입의 주행 테스트에 성공한 바 있다. 최근에는 제조 공장 구축도 완료했다. 이 기술력을 바탕으로 하이퍼루프원은 2020년 상용화에 나설 것이라고 장담하고 있다.

카카오가 내놓은 고삐 풀린 SNS, ‘썹’
 카카오가 지난 8월9일 ‘막 나가는’ 소셜미디어 서비스를 내놨다. ‘썹(ssup)’이다. 안부를 물을 때 쓰는 ‘What’s up?’ 이란 문장의 약어다.
 썹은 이모지가 중심이 되는 서비스다. 이모지로 홈의 배경화면을 만들 수 있고, 리액션에도 활용한다. 하트 모양의 ‘좋아요’를 찍는 데는 제한이 없다. 한 명이 100개, 200개의 ‘좋아요’를 눌러도 상관없다. 포스트에도 이모지를 붙일 수 있다. 과거 싸이월드의 다이어리를 떠올리게 하는 기능이지만, 힘을 내라며 박카스 스티커를 붙여주는 그때의 감성은 아니다. ‘고삐 풀린 자아의 대폭발’이라는 자기소개가 무색하지 않다. 적당히 재미있게 ‘정신 나간’ 기능이 빼곡히 들어가 있다. 그간 카카오가 내놨던 ‘카카오스토리’의 반대편에 있는 감성이다. 커뮤니티와 소셜미디어의 최신 유행에 익숙한 젊은 세대가 타깃으로 보인다.
 ‘에그워드’도 포스트를 다양하게 만드는 기능이다. 글에 다양한 콘텐츠를 첨부할 수 있게 돕는다. 짤방(GIF 파일)을 검색할 수 있게 해뒀고, 영화나 TV 프로그램도 검색할 수 있다. 위치정보 수신에 동의하면 날씨 에그워드를 사용할 수 있고, 운세도 봐준다. 그 외에 짧게 안부를 남기는 ‘HEY!’도 인상깊다. 출시한 지 만 하루가 되지 않았지만, 사용자들의 반응은 무척 좋은 편이다.
 소셜미디어는 관계에 바탕하지만, 사용자들은 그 관계 때문에 말을 삼키는 경향을 보인다. 피로감을 느끼게 되고, 타인의 시선을 생각하게 되면서 말을 다듬거나 삼키게 된다. 썹은 훨씬 가볍게 사용하면서 ‘아무 말이나’ 할 수 있게 구성됐다. 네티즌들은 “뭐랄까 아스트랄 하달까 뭔가 도처에 병맛이 가득하다”, “쓰고 있지만 카카오라는 게 믿기지 않는다”, “병맛이 넘쳐난다”는 반응이다.(8.10 기준 플레이스토어 ‘썹’ 리뷰)

오라클 ERP가 클라우드로 가야 했던 까닭
 데이터베이스(DB) 분야 절대 강자인 오라클이 쉽게 넘보지 못하는 영역이 있다. 기업용 애플리케이션 영역이다. DB로 얻은 막대한 수익을 바탕으로 피플소프트, J.D에드워드, 시벨, TOA테크놀로지스 등을 인수하면서 기업용 애플리케이션 시장에 뛰어들었지만, SAP 벽이 만만찮다.
 이 벽을 깨뜨리기 위해 오라클이 최근 꺼내든 무기는 클라우드다. 앞서 오라클은 ‘넘어서(Beyond)’라는 전략을 통해 기존 애플리케이션 시장 패러다임을 바꾸겠다고 나섰다. 기존 전사적자원관리(ERP) 솔루션에 전략적 비즈니스 요구를 더해 유연한 방식으로 비즈니스를 확장하는 기업 내·외부 애플리케이션을 도입하겠다고 했다.
 그러나 시장이 너무 빠르게 움직이고 있다. IT 변화는 수시로 일어났고, 이런 변화에 좀 더 민감하게 대응할 방법이 필요했다. 근무 환경도 달라졌다. 데스크톱PC에서 노트북, 태블릿, 모바일을 넘나들며 일하는 문화가 펴져나갔다. 기능을 추가로 제공하는 형태에서 더 나아가 다른 접근이 필요했다.

The Data-Poor Lives of Adolescents
 
 SEATTLE ? Data can save lives. Without it, we wouldn’t know that smoking causes lung cancer and coronary disease, that helmets reduce death rates for motorcycle accidents, and that better education for women improves child survival ? and much else. Given the importance of reliable data, collecting it must be a high priority.
 One area where data collection is particularly inadequate is adolescent health. People aged ten to 24 receive far less attention than other age groups. More broadly, as the new Lancet Commission on Adolescent Health and Wellbeing highlights, global health and social policy largely tends to ignore adolescent health.
 In many ways, our future depends on the health of our adolescents. In low- and middle-income countries, there are more adolescents than ever before. And their health today will affect their future wellbeing, shaping their ability to earn a living, produce and raise healthy children, care for aging parents, and lead their societies toward peace and prosperity.
